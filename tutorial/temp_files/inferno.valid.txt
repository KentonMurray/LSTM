as were the torment , if each lazar - house
of valdichiana , in the sultry time
'twixt july and september , with the isle
sardinia and maremma's pestilent fen ,
had heap'd their maladies all in one foss
together ; such was here the torment : dire
the stench , as issuing steams from fester'd limbs .
we on the utmost shore of the long rock
descended still to leftward . then my sight
was livelier to explore the depth , wherein
the minister of the most mighty lord ,
all - searching justice , dooms to punishment
the forgers noted on her dread record .
more rueful was it not methinks to see
the nation in aegina droop , what time
each living thing , e'en to the little worm ,
all fell , so full of malice was the air
( and afterward , as bards of yore have told ,
the ancient people were restor'd anew
from seed of emmets ) than was here to see
the spirits , that languish'd through the murky vale
up - pil'd on many a stack . confus'd they lay ,
one o'er the belly , o'er the shoulders one
roll'd of another ; sideling crawl'd a third
along the dismal pathway . step by step
we journey'd on , in silence looking round
and list'ning those diseas'd , who strove in vain
to lift their forms . then two i mark'd , that sat
propp'd 'gainst each other , as two brazen pans
set to retain the heat . from head to foot ,
a tetter bark'd them round . nor saw i e'er
groom currying so fast , for whom his lord
impatient waited , or himself perchance
tir'd with long watching , as of these each one
plied quickly his keen nails , through furiousness
of ne'er abated pruriency . the crust
came drawn from underneath in flakes , like scales
scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail .
" o thou , who with thy fingers rendest off
thy coat of proof , " thus spake my guide to one ,
" and sometimes makest tearing pincers of them ,
tell me if any born of latian land
be among these within : so may thy nails
serve thee for everlasting to this toil . "
" both are of latium , " weeping he replied ,
" whom tortur'd thus thou seest : but who art thou
that hast inquir'd of us ? " to whom my guide :
" one that descend with this man , who yet lives ,
from rock to rock , and show him hell's abyss . "
then started they asunder , and each turn'd
trembling toward us , with the rest , whose ear
those words redounding struck . to me my liege
address'd him : " speak to them whate'er thou list . "
and i therewith began : " so may no time
filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
in th' upper world , but after many suns
survive it , as ye tell me , who ye are ,
and of what race ye come . your punishment ,
unseemly and disgustful in its kind ,
deter you not from opening thus much to me . "
" arezzo was my dwelling , " answer'd one ,
" and me albero of sienna brought
to die by fire ; but that , for which i died ,
leads me not here . true is in sport i told him ,
that i had learn'd to wing my flight in air .
and he admiring much , as he was void
of wisdom , will'd me to declare to him
the secret of mine art : and only hence ,
because i made him not a daedalus ,
prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me .
but minos to this chasm last of the ten ,
for that i practis'd alchemy on earth ,
has doom'd me . him no subterfuge eludes . "
then to the bard i spake : " was ever race
light as sienna's ? sure not france herself
can show a tribe so frivolous and vain . "
the other leprous spirit heard my words ,
and thus return'd : " be stricca from this charge
exempted , he who knew so temp'rately
to lay out fortune's gifts ; and niccolo
who first the spice's costly luxury
discover'd in that garden , where such seed
roots deepest in the soil : and be that troop
exempted , with whom caccia of asciano
lavish'd his vineyards and wide - spreading woods ,
and his rare wisdom abbagliato show'd
a spectacle for all . that thou mayst know
who seconds thee against the siennese
thus gladly , bend this way thy sharpen'd sight ,
that well my face may answer to thy ken ;
so shalt thou see i am capocchio's ghost ,
who forg'd transmuted metals by the power
of alchemy ; and if i scan thee right ,
thus needs must well remember how i aped
creative nature by my subtle art . "
what time resentment burn'd in juno's breast
for semele against the theban blood ,
as more than once in dire mischance was rued ,
such fatal frenzy seiz'd on athamas ,
that he his spouse beholding with a babe
laden on either arm , " spread out , " he cried ,
" the meshes , that i take the lioness
and the young lions at the pass : " then forth
stretch'd he his merciless talons , grasping one ,
one helpless innocent , learchus nam'd ,
whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock ,
and with her other burden self - destroy'd
the hapless mother plung'd : and when the pride
of all - presuming troy fell from its height ,
by fortune overwhelm'd , and the old king
with his realm perish'd , then did hecuba ,
a wretch forlorn and captive , when she saw
polyxena first slaughter'd , and her son ,
her polydorus , on the wild sea - beach
next met the mourner's view , then reft of sense
did she run barking even as a dog ;
such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul .
bet ne'er the furies or of thebes or troy
with such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
infixing in the limbs of man or beast ,
as now two pale and naked ghost i saw
that gnarling wildly scamper'd , like the swine
excluded from his stye . one reach'd capocchio ,
and in the neck - joint sticking deep his fangs ,
dragg'd him , that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd
his belly stretch'd out prone . the other shape ,
he of arezzo , there left trembling , spake ;
" that sprite of air is schicchi ; in like mood
of random mischief vent he still his spite . "
to whom i answ'ring : " oh ! as thou dost hope ,
the other may not flesh its jaws on thee ,
be patient to inform us , who it is ,
ere it speed hence . " -- " that is the ancient soul
of wretched myrrha , " he replied , " who burn'd
with most unholy flame for her own sire ,
" and a false shape assuming , so perform'd
the deed of sin ; e'en as the other there ,
that onward passes , dar'd to counterfeit
donati's features , to feign'd testament
the seal affixing , that himself might gain ,
for his own share , the lady of the herd . "
when vanish'd the two furious shades , on whom
mine eye was held , i turn'd it back to view
the other cursed spirits . one i saw
in fashion like a lute , had but the groin
been sever'd , where it meets the forked part .
swoln dropsy , disproportioning the limbs
with ill - converted moisture , that the paunch
suits not the visage , open'd wide his lips
gasping as in the hectic man for drought ,
one towards the chin , the other upward curl'd .
" o ye , who in this world of misery ,
wherefore i know not , are exempt from pain , "
thus he began , " attentively regard
adamo's woe . when living , full supply
ne'er lack'd me of what most i coveted ;
one drop of water now , alas ! i crave .
the rills , that glitter down the grassy slopes
of casentino , making fresh and soft
the banks whereby they glide to arno's stream ,
stand ever in my view ; and not in vain ;
for more the pictur'd semblance dries me up ,
much more than the disease , which makes the flesh
desert these shrivel'd cheeks . so from the place ,
where i transgress'd , stern justice urging me ,
takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs .
there is romena , where i falsified
the metal with the baptist's form imprest ,
for which on earth i left my body burnt .
but if i here might see the sorrowing soul
of guido , alessandro , or their brother ,
for branda's limpid spring i would not change
the welcome sight . one is e'en now within ,
if truly the mad spirits tell , that round
are wand'ring . but wherein besteads me that ?
my limbs are fetter'd . were i but so light ,
that i each hundred years might move one inch ,
i had set forth already on this path ,
seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew ,
although eleven miles it wind , not more
than half of one across . they brought me down
among this tribe ; induc'd by them i stamp'd
the florens with three carats of alloy . "
" who are that abject pair , " i next inquir'd ,
" that closely bounding thee upon thy right
lie smoking , like a band in winter steep'd
in the chill stream ? " -- " when to this gulf i dropt , "
he answer'd , " here i found them ; since that hour
they have not turn'd , nor ever shall , i ween ,
till time hath run his course . one is that dame
the false accuser of the hebrew youth ;
sinon the other , that false greek from troy .
sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out ,
in such a cloud upsteam'd . " when that he heard ,
one , gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd ,
with clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch ,
that like a drum resounded : but forthwith
adamo smote him on the face , the blow
returning with his arm , that seem'd as hard .
" though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me
the power to move , " said he , " i have an arm
at liberty for such employ . " to whom
was answer'd : " when thou wentest to the fire ,
thou hadst it not so ready at command ,
then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold . "
and thus the dropsied : " ay , now speak'st thou true .
but there thou gav'st not such true testimony ,
when thou wast question'd of the truth , at troy . "
" if i spake false , thou falsely stamp'dst the coin , "
said sinon ; " i am here but for one fault ,
and thou for more than any imp beside . "
" remember , " he replied , " o perjur'd one ,
the horse remember , that did teem with death ,
and all the world be witness to thy guilt . "
" to thine , " return'd the greek , " witness the thirst
whence thy tongue cracks , witness the fluid mound ,
rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes ,
a mass corrupt . " to whom the coiner thus :
" thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
its evil saying . me if thirst assails ,
yet i am stuff'd with moisture . thou art parch'd ,
pains rack thy head , no urging would'st thou need
to make thee lap narcissus' mirror up . "
i was all fix'd to listen , when my guide
admonish'd : " now beware : a little more .
and i do quarrel with thee . " i perceiv'd
how angrily he spake , and towards him turn'd
with shame so poignant , as remember'd yet
confounds me . as a man that dreams of harm
befall'n him , dreaming wishes it a dream ,
and that which is , desires as if it were not ,
such then was i , who wanting power to speak
wish'd to excuse myself , and all the while
excus'd me , though unweeting that i did .
" more grievous fault than thine has been , less shame , "
my master cried , " might expiate . therefore cast
all sorrow from thy soul ; and if again
chance bring thee , where like conference is held ,
think i am ever at thy side . to hear
such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds . "
the very tongue , whose keen reproof before
had wounded me , that either cheek was stain'd ,
now minister'd my cure . so have i heard ,
achilles and his father's javelin caus'd
pain first , and then the boon of health restor'd .
turning our back upon the vale of woe ,
w cross'd th' encircled mound in silence . there
was twilight dim , that far long the gloom
mine eye advanc'd not : but i heard a horn
sounded aloud . the peal it blew had made
the thunder feeble . following its course
the adverse way , my strained eyes were bent
on that one spot . so terrible a blast
orlando blew not , when that dismal rout
o'erthrew the host of charlemagne , and quench'd
his saintly warfare . thitherward not long
my head was rais'd , when many lofty towers
methought i spied . " master , " said i , " what land
is this ? " he answer'd straight : " too long a space
of intervening darkness has thine eye
to traverse : thou hast therefore widely err'd
in thy imagining . thither arriv'd
thou well shalt see , how distance can delude
the sense . a little therefore urge thee on . "
then tenderly he caught me by the hand ;
" yet know , " said he , " ere farther we advance ,
that it less strange may seem , these are not towers ,
but giants . in the pit they stand immers'd ,
each from his navel downward , round the bank . "
as when a fog disperseth gradually ,
our vision traces what the mist involves
condens'd in air ; so piercing through the gross
and gloomy atmosphere , as more and more
we near'd toward the brink , mine error fled ,
and fear came o'er me . as with circling round
of turrets , montereggion crowns his walls ,
e'en thus the shore , encompassing th' abyss ,
was turreted with giants , half their length
uprearing , horrible , whom jove from heav'n
yet threatens , when his mutt'ring thunder rolls .
of one already i descried the face ,
shoulders , and breast , and of the belly huge
great part , and both arms down along his ribs .
all - teeming nature , when her plastic hand
left framing of these monsters , did display
past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad war
such slaves to do his bidding ; and if she
repent her not of th' elephant and whale ,
who ponders well confesses her therein
wiser and more discreet ; for when brute force
and evil will are back'd with subtlety ,
resistance none avails . his visage seem'd
in length and bulk , as doth the pine , that tops
saint peter's roman fane ; and th' other bones
of like proportion , so that from above
the bank , which girdled him below , such height
arose his stature , that three friezelanders
had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair .
full thirty ample palms was he expos'd
downward from whence a man his garments loops .
" raphel bai ameth sabi almi , "
so shouted his fierce lips , which sweeter hymns
became not ; and my guide address'd him thus :
" o senseless spirit ! let thy horn for thee
interpret : therewith vent thy rage , if rage
or other passion wring thee . search thy neck ,
there shalt thou find the belt that binds it on .
wild spirit ! lo , upon thy mighty breast
where hangs the baldrick ! " then to me he spake :
" he doth accuse himself . nimrod is this ,
through whose ill counsel in the world no more
one tongue prevails . but pass we on , nor waste
our words ; for so each language is to him ,
as his to others , understood by none . "
then to the leftward turning sped we forth ,
and at a sling's throw found another shade
far fiercer and more huge . i cannot say
what master hand had girt him ; but he held
behind the right arm fetter'd , and before
the other with a chain , that fasten'd him
from the neck down , and five times round his form
apparent met the wreathed links . " this proud one
would of his strength against almighty jove
make trial , " said my guide ; " whence he is thus
requited : ephialtes him they call .
" great was his prowess , when the giants brought
fear on the gods : those arms , which then he piled ,
now moves he never . " forthwith i return'd :
" fain would i , if 't were possible , mine eyes
of briareus immeasurable gain'd
experience next . " he answer'd : " thou shalt see
not far from hence antaeus , who both speaks
and is unfetter'd , who shall place us there
where guilt is at its depth . far onward stands
whom thou wouldst fain behold , in chains , and made
like to this spirit , save that in his looks
more fell he seems . " by violent earthquake rock'd
ne'er shook a tow'r , so reeling to its base ,
as ephialtes . more than ever then
i dreaded death , nor than the terror more
had needed , if i had not seen the cords
that held him fast . we , straightway journeying on ,
came to antaeus , who five ells complete
without the head , forth issued from the cave .
" o thou , who in the fortunate vale , that made
great scipio heir of glory , when his sword
drove back the troop of hannibal in flight ,
who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
an hundred lions ; and if thou hadst fought
in the high conflict on thy brethren's side ,
seems as men yet believ'd , that through thine arm
the sons of earth had conquer'd , now vouchsafe
to place us down beneath , where numbing cold
locks up cocytus . force not that we crave
or tityus' help or typhon's . here is one
can give what in this realm ye covet . stoop
therefore , nor scornfully distort thy lip .
he in the upper world can yet bestow
renown on thee , for he doth live , and looks
for life yet longer , if before the time
grace call him not unto herself . " thus spake
the teacher . he in haste forth stretch'd his hands ,
and caught my guide . alcides whilom felt
that grapple straighten'd score . soon as my guide
had felt it , he bespake me thus : " this way
that i may clasp thee ; " then so caught me up ,
that we were both one burden . as appears
the tower of carisenda , from beneath
where it doth lean , if chance a passing cloud
so sail across , that opposite it hangs ,
such then antaeus seem'd , as at mine ease
i mark'd him stooping . i were fain at times
t' have pass'd another way . yet in th' abyss ,
that lucifer with judas low ingulfs ,
lightly he plac'd us ; nor there leaning stay'd ,
but rose as in a bark the stately mast .
could i command rough rhimes and hoarse , to suit
that hole of sorrow , o'er which ev'ry rock
his firm abutment rears , then might the vein
of fancy rise full springing : but not mine
such measures , and with falt'ring awe i touch
the mighty theme ; for to describe the depth
of all the universe , is no emprize
to jest with , and demands a tongue not us'd
to infant babbling . but let them assist
my song , the tuneful maidens , by whose aid
amphion wall'd in thebes , so with the truth
my speech shall best accord . oh ill - starr'd folk ,
beyond all others wretched ! who abide
in such a mansion , as scarce thought finds words
to speak of , better had ye here on earth
been flocks or mountain goats . as down we stood
in the dark pit beneath the giants' feet ,
but lower far than they , and i did gaze
still on the lofty battlement , a voice
bespoke me thus : " look how thou walkest . take
good heed , thy soles do tread not on the heads
of thy poor brethren . " thereupon i turn'd ,
and saw before and underneath my feet
a lake , whose frozen surface liker seem'd
