to <unk> than water . not so thick a <unk>
in <unk> e'er hath <unk> <unk> spread
o'er his still course , nor <unk> far remote
under the <unk> sky . roll'd o'er that mass
had <unk> or <unk> fall'n ,
not e'en its <unk> had <unk> . as <unk> the frog
<unk> above the wave , what time in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> oft <unk> her toil ,
so , to where <unk> shame <unk> , thus low
<unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> the spirits stood ,
moving their teeth in shrill note like the <unk> .
his face each downward held ; their mouth the <unk> ,
their eyes <unk> the <unk> of their heart .
a space i look'd around , then at my feet
saw two so <unk> join'd , that of their head
the <unk> <unk> were <unk> . " tell me ye ,
whose <unk> thus together <unk> , " said i ,
" who are ye ? " at that sound their <unk> they bent ,
and when their looks were lifted up to me ,
straightway their eyes , before all <unk> within ,
<unk> upon their lips , and the <unk> bound
the tears betwixt those <unk> and held them there .
<unk> unto <unk> hath never <unk> clos'd up
so <unk> . whence like two <unk> <unk>
they <unk> together ; them such fury seiz'd .
and one , from whom the <unk> both ears had reft ,
exclaim'd , still looking downward : " why on us
dost <unk> so long ? if thou wouldst know
who are these two , the valley , whence his wave
<unk> <unk> , did for its master own
their sire <unk> , and next him themselves .
they from one body issued ; and throughout
<unk> thou mayst search , nor find a shade
more worthy in <unk> to be fix'd ,
not him , whose breast and <unk> <unk> land
at that one blow <unk> , not <unk> ,
no not this spirit , whose <unk> head
<unk> my onward view : he bore the name
of <unk> : tuscan if thou be ,
well knowest who he was : and to cut short
all further question , in my form behold
what once was <unk> . i <unk>
<unk> here my <unk> , whose deep guilt
shall <unk> out mine . " a thousand <unk>
then mark'd i , which the keen and eager <unk>
had shap'd into a <unk> <unk> ; whence <unk>
a <unk> horror o'er me , at the thought
of those <unk> <unk> . while we journey'd on
toward the middle , at whose point <unk>
all heavy substance , and i trembling went
through that eternal <unk> , i know not
if will it were or destiny , or chance ,
but , passing 'midst the heads , my foot did strike
with violent blow against the face of one .
" wherefore dost <unk> me ? " weeping , he exclaim'd ,
" unless thy <unk> be some fresh revenge
for <unk> , wherefore <unk> me ? "
i thus : " instructor , now <unk> me here ,
that i through him may <unk> me of my doubt .
<unk> what haste thou <unk> . " the teacher paus'd ,
and to that shade i spake , who <unk>
still curs'd me in his wrath . " what art thou , speak ,
that <unk> thus on others ? " he replied :
" now who art thou , that <unk> <unk> cheeks
through <unk> <unk> , with such force
as were past <unk> , <unk> thou living still ? "
" and i am living , to thy joy perchance , "
was my reply , " if fame be dear to thee ,
that with the rest i may thy name <unk> . "
" the <unk> of what i <unk> most , "
said he , " thou <unk> : hence ; nor <unk> me more .
ill knowest thou to <unk> in this vale . "
then <unk> on his hinder <unk> , i cried :
" name thee , or not a hair shall tarry here . "
" rend all away , " he answer'd , " yet for that
i will not tell nor show thee who i am ,
though at my head thou <unk> a thousand times . "
now i had grasp'd his tresses , and <unk> off
more than one <unk> , he <unk> , with his eyes
drawn in and downward , when another cried ,
" what <unk> thee , <unk> ? sound not loud enough
thy <unk> teeth , but thou must bark <unk> ?
what devil <unk> thee ? " -- " now , " said i , " be <unk> ,
accursed traitor ! to thy shame of thee
true tidings will i bear . " -- " off , " he replied ,
" tell what thou <unk> ; but as thou escape from hence
to speak of him whose tongue hath been so <unk> ,
<unk> not : here he <unk> the <unk> gold .
<unk> of <unk> , ' thou canst say , <unk> mark'd ,
where the <unk> sinners <unk> . ' if thou be ask'd
what other shade was with them , at thy side
is <unk> , whose red <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> of florence . farther on ,
if i <unk> not , <unk> <unk> ,
with <unk> , and <unk> , him
who <unk> <unk> when the people <unk> . "
we now had left him , passing on our way ,
when i beheld two spirits by the <unk>
<unk> in one hollow , that the head of one
was <unk> unto the other ; and as <unk>
is <unk> up through hunger , th' <unk>
did so <unk> his fangs to th' other's brain ,
where the <unk> joins it . not more <unk>
on <unk> temples <unk> <unk> ,
than on that <unk> and on its <unk> he .
" o thou who <unk> so <unk> sign of <unk>
'gainst him thou <unk> on , let me hear , " said i
" the cause , on such <unk> , that if right
<unk> thy <unk> , <unk> who ye are ,
and what the colour of his <unk> was ,
i may <unk> thee in the world above ,
if that , wherewith i speak be <unk> so long . "
his jaws <unk> from their fell <unk> ,
that sinner <unk> them on the <unk> <unk> th' head ,
which he behind had mangled , then began :
" thy will <unk> , i call up <unk>
sorrow past cure , which but to think of <unk>
my heart , or ere i tell <unk> . but if words ,
that i may utter , shall <unk> seed to bear
fruit of eternal infamy to him ,
the traitor whom i <unk> at , thou at once
shalt see me speak and <unk> . who thou mayst be
i know not , nor how here below art come :
but <unk> thou <unk> of a truth ,
when i do hear thee . know i was on earth
<unk> <unk> , and th' <unk> he
<unk> . why i neighbour him so close ,
now <unk> . that through effect of his ill thoughts
in him my trust <unk> , i was <unk>
and after <unk> , need is not i tell .
what therefore thou canst not have heard , that is ,
how cruel was the <unk> , shalt thou hear ,
and know if he have <unk> me . a small <unk>
within that <unk> , which for my sake the name
of <unk> bears , where others yet must <unk> ,
already through its opening <unk> <unk>
had shown me , when i <unk> the evil sleep ,
that from the future tore the <unk> off .
this one , methought , as master of the sport ,
<unk> forth to chase the <unk> wolf and his <unk>
unto the mountain , which <unk> the sight
of <unk> to the <unk> . with <unk> <unk>
<unk> and keen , before him <unk>
<unk> with <unk> and <unk> .
after short course the father and the sons
seem'd <unk> and <unk> , and methought i saw
the sharp <unk> <unk> their sides . when i <unk>
before the dawn , amid their sleep i heard
my sons ( for they were with me ) <unk> and ask
for <unk> . right cruel art thou , if no pang
thou feel at <unk> what my heart <unk> ;
and if not now , why use thy tears to <unk> ?
now had they <unk> ; and the hour drew near
when they were wont to bring us food ; the mind
of each <unk> him through his <unk> , and i
heard , at its <unk> underneath <unk> up
the' horrible <unk> : whence <unk> not a word
i look'd upon the visage of my sons .
i wept not : so all stone i felt within .
they wept : and one , my little <unk> , cried :
" thou <unk> so ! father what <unk> thee ? " yet
i <unk> no tear , nor answer'd all that day
nor the next night , until another sun
came out upon the world . when a faint beam
had to our <unk> <unk> made its way ,
and in four <unk> i <unk>
the image of my own , on either hand
through agony i <unk> , and they who thought
i did it through desire of feeding , rose
<unk> th' sudden , and cried , <unk> , we should <unk>
far less , if thou wouldst <unk> of us : thou <unk>
these <unk> of miserable flesh we wear ,
<unk> do thou <unk> them off from us again . '
then , not to make them <unk> , i kept down
my spirit in <unk> . that day and the next
we all were silent . ah , <unk> earth !
why <unk> not upon us ? when we came
to the fourth day , then <unk> at my feet
outstretch'd did <unk> him , <unk> , <unk> no help
for me , my father ! ' there he <unk> , and e'en
<unk> as thou seest me , saw i the three
fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth :
" whence i <unk> me now <unk> blind to <unk>
over them all , and for three days aloud
call'd on them who were dead . then <unk> <unk>
the <unk> of grief . " thus having spoke ,
once more upon the wretched <unk> his teeth
he <unk> , like a <unk> 'gainst the bone
firm and <unk> . oh thou <unk> ! shame
of all the people , who their dwelling make
in that fair region , where th' <unk> voice
is heard , since that thy <unk> are so <unk>
to <unk> , from their deep <unk> rise
<unk> and <unk> , and <unk> up
the mouth of <unk> , that each soul in thee
may <unk> in the waters ! what if fame
<unk> that thy <unk> were <unk>
by <unk> , yet no right hadst thou
to <unk> his <unk> on the <unk> . for them ,
<unk> , <unk> , and the <unk>
of gentle <unk> , of whom my song hath told ,
their <unk> years , thou <unk> thebes ! did make
<unk> of guilt . onward we pass'd ,
where others <unk> in rugged <unk> of <unk>
not on their feet were turn'd , but each revers'd .
there <unk> weeping <unk> not to <unk> ;
for at their eyes grief <unk> passage <unk>
<unk> , and <unk> inward turns
for <unk> of sharp anguish : the first tears
<unk> <unk> , and like <unk> <unk> show ,
under the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
now though the <unk> had from my face <unk>
each <unk> , as 't were <unk> , yet me seem'd
some breath of wind i felt . " whence <unk> this , "
said i , " my master ? is not here below
all vapour quench'd ? " -- " <unk> shalt be speedily , "
he answer'd , " where thine eye shall tell thee whence
the cause <unk> of this <unk> <unk> . "
then cried out one in the <unk> <unk> who mourn'd :
" o souls so cruel ! that the <unk> <unk>
hath been assign'd you , from this face <unk>
the <unk> <unk> , that i may <unk> the grief
<unk> at my heart , some little space
ere it <unk> again ! " i thus replied :
" say who thou wast , if thou wouldst have mine aid ;
and if i <unk> thee not , far down
as to the lowest <unk> may i descend ! "
" the friar <unk> , " <unk> he ,
" am i , who from the evil <unk> <unk>
its <unk> , and am here <unk> , the <unk>
more <unk> for my <unk> . " -- " <unk> ! " i exclaim'd ,
" art thou too dead ! " -- " how in the world aloft
it <unk> with my body , " answer'd he ,
" i am right <unk> . such <unk>
hath <unk> , that ofttimes the soul
<unk> hither , ere by <unk> <unk> .
and that thou mayst <unk> out more <unk>
the <unk> tear - <unk> that <unk> mine eyes ,
know that the soul , that moment she <unk> ,
as i did , <unk> her body to a fiend
who after moves and <unk> it at will ,
till all its time be <unk> ; headlong she
falls to this <unk> . and perchance above
doth yet appear the body of a <unk> ,
who here behind me <unk> . him thou know'st ,
if thou but newly art arriv'd below .
the years are many that have pass'd away ,
since to this <unk> <unk> <unk> came . "
" now , " answer'd i , " <unk> thou <unk> me ,
for <unk> <unk> never yet hath <unk> ,
but doth all <unk> <unk> of a man ,
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on . "
he thus : " not yet unto that upper foss
by th' evil talons <unk> , where the pitch
<unk> <unk> , had <unk> <unk> reach'd ,
when this one left a demon in his <unk>
in his own body , and of one his <unk> ,
who with him <unk> wrought . but now <unk> forth
thy hand , and <unk> mine eyes . " i <unk> them not .
ill <unk> were best courtesy to him .
ah <unk> ! men <unk> in every way ,
with every <unk> stain'd , why from the earth
are ye not <unk> ? such an one of yours
i with <unk> <unk> spirit found ,
as for his <unk> even now in soul
is in <unk> <unk> , and yet doth seem
in body still alive upon the earth .
" the <unk> of <unk> monarch do come forth
towards us ; therefore look , " so spake my guide ,
" if thou discern him . " as , when <unk> a cloud
heavy and <unk> , or when the shades of night
fall on our hemisphere , seems view'd from far
a <unk> , which the blast <unk> <unk> round ,
such was the <unk> then methought i saw ,
to <unk> me from the wind , forthwith i drew
behind my guide : no <unk> else was there .
now came i ( and with fear i bid my strain
record the <unk> ) where the souls were all
whelm'd underneath , <unk> , as through <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> . some prone were laid ,
others stood upright , this upon the <unk> ,
that on his head , a third with face to feet
<unk> like a bow . when to the point we came ,
whereat my guide was pleas'd that i should see
the <unk> eminent in <unk> once ,
he from before me <unk> and made me pause .
" lo ! " he exclaim'd , " lo dis ! and lo the place ,
where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength . "
how <unk> and how faint i then became ,
ask me not , reader ! for i <unk> it not ,
since words would <unk> to tell thee of my state .
i was not dead nor living . think thyself
if quick <unk> work in thee at all ,
how i did feel . that <unk> , who <unk>
the realm of sorrow , at <unk> breast from th' <unk>
stood forth ; and i in <unk> am more like
a <unk> , than the <unk> are in his arms .
mark now how great that whole must be , which suits
with such a part . if he were <unk>
as he is hideous now , and yet did <unk>
to <unk> upon his <unk> , well from him
may all our mis'ry <unk> . oh what a sight !
how passing strange it seem'd , when i did spy
upon his head three faces : one in front
of hue vermilion , th' other two with this
midway each <unk> join'd and at the <unk> ;
the right 'twixt <unk> and <unk> seem'd : the left
to look on , such as come from whence old <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> . under each shot forth
two mighty wings , <unk> as became
a bird so vast . sails never such i saw
outstretch'd on the wide sea . no plumes had they ,
but were in <unk> like a <unk> , and these
he <unk> i' th' air , that from him issued still
three winds , wherewith <unk> to its depth
was <unk> . at six eyes he wept : the tears
<unk> three <unk> <unk> with bloody foam .
at every mouth his teeth a sinner <unk>
<unk> as with <unk> <unk> , so that three
were in this guise tormented . but far more
than from that <unk> , was the foremost <unk>
by the fierce <unk> , whence ofttimes the back
was <unk> of all its skin . " that upper spirit ,
who hath worse punishment , " so spake my guide ,
" is <unk> , he that hath his head within
and <unk> the feet without . of th' other two ,
whose heads are under , from the murky <unk>
who hangs , is <unk> : lo ! how he doth <unk>
and speaks not ! th' other <unk> , that <unk>
so large of limb . but night now re - <unk> ,
and it is time for parting . all is seen . "
i <unk> him round the neck , for so he bade ;
and <unk> time and place , he , when the wings
enough were <unk> , caught fast the shaggy sides ,
and down from pile to pile descending <unk>
between the thick fell and the <unk> <unk> .
soon as he reach'd the point , whereat the <unk>
upon the <unk> of the <unk> turns ,
my leader there with pain and struggling hard
turn'd round his head , where his feet stood before ,
and grappled at the fell , as one who <unk> ,
that into hell methought we turn'd again .
" expect that by such <unk> as these , " thus spake
the teacher , <unk> like a man <unk> ,
" we must depart from evil so extreme . "
then at a rocky opening issued forth ,
and plac'd me on a brink to sit , next join'd
with <unk> step my side . i rais'd mine eyes ,
<unk> that i <unk> should see
where he was lately left , but saw him now
with legs held upward . let the <unk> sort ,
who see not what the point was i had pass'd ,
<unk> them if sore toil oppress'd me then .
" arise , " my master cried , " upon thy feet .
the way is long , and much <unk> the road ;
and now within one hour and <unk> of <unk>
the sun returns . " it was no <unk> - <unk>
lofty and <unk> wherein we stood ,
but <unk> <unk> where ill <unk> was
and <unk> <unk> of light . " ere from th' abyss
i sep'rate , " thus when risen i began ,
" my guide ! vouchsafe few words to set me <unk>
from <unk> <unk> . where is now the <unk> ?
how <unk> he in <unk> thus revers'd ?
and how from <unk> to <unk> in space so brief
hath the sun made his <unk> ? " he in few
thus answering spake : " thou <unk> thou art still
on th' other side the centre , where i grasp'd
th' <unk> <unk> , that <unk> through the world .
thou wast on th' other side , so long as i
descended ; when i turn'd , thou didst <unk>
that point , to which from <unk> part is dragg'd
all heavy substance . thou art now arriv'd
under the hemisphere <unk> to that ,
which the great <unk> doth <unk> ,
and underneath whose <unk> <unk>
the man , that was born <unk> , and so liv'd .
thy feet are planted on the <unk> <unk> ,
whose other aspect is <unk> . <unk>
here rises , when there <unk> sets : and he ,
whose shaggy pile was <unk> , yet <unk> fix'd ,
as at the first . on this part he fell down
from heav'n ; and th' earth , here <unk> before ,
through fear of him did <unk> her with the sea ,
and to our hemisphere retir'd . perchance
to shun him was the <unk> space left here
by what of firm land on this side <unk> ,
that sprang aloof . " there is a place beneath ,
from <unk> as distant , as <unk>
the <unk> tomb , discover'd not by sight ,
but by the sound of <unk> , that descends
this way along the hollow of a rock ,
which , as it winds with no <unk> course ,
the wave hath <unk> . by that <unk> way
my guide and i did enter , to return
to the fair world : and <unk> of <unk>
we <unk> , he first , i following his steps ,
till on our view the <unk> <unk> of heav'n
<unk> through a <unk> opening in the cave :
thus issuing we again beheld the stars .
