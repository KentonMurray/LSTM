to glass than water . not so thick a veil
in winter e'er hath austrian danube spread
o'er his still course , nor tanais far remote
under the chilling sky . roll'd o'er that mass
had tabernich or pietrapana fall'n ,
not e'en its rim had creak'd . as peeps the frog
croaking above the wave , what time in dreams
the village gleaner oft pursues her toil ,
so , to where modest shame appears , thus low
blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood ,
moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork .
his face each downward held ; their mouth the cold ,
their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart .
a space i look'd around , then at my feet
saw two so strictly join'd , that of their head
the very hairs were mingled . " tell me ye ,
whose bosoms thus together press , " said i ,
" who are ye ? " at that sound their necks they bent ,
and when their looks were lifted up to me ,
straightway their eyes , before all moist within ,
distill'd upon their lips , and the frost bound
the tears betwixt those orbs and held them there .
plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up
so stoutly . whence like two enraged goats
they clash'd together ; them such fury seiz'd .
and one , from whom the cold both ears had reft ,
exclaim'd , still looking downward : " why on us
dost speculate so long ? if thou wouldst know
who are these two , the valley , whence his wave
bisenzio slopes , did for its master own
their sire alberto , and next him themselves .
they from one body issued ; and throughout
caina thou mayst search , nor find a shade
more worthy in congealment to be fix'd ,
not him , whose breast and shadow arthur's land
at that one blow dissever'd , not focaccia ,
no not this spirit , whose o'erjutting head
obstructs my onward view : he bore the name
of mascheroni : tuscan if thou be ,
well knowest who he was : and to cut short
all further question , in my form behold
what once was camiccione . i await
carlino here my kinsman , whose deep guilt
shall wash out mine . " a thousand visages
then mark'd i , which the keen and eager cold
had shap'd into a doggish grin ; whence creeps
a shiv'ring horror o'er me , at the thought
of those frore shallows . while we journey'd on
toward the middle , at whose point unites
all heavy substance , and i trembling went
through that eternal chillness , i know not
if will it were or destiny , or chance ,
but , passing 'midst the heads , my foot did strike
with violent blow against the face of one .
" wherefore dost bruise me ? " weeping , he exclaim'd ,
" unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
for montaperto , wherefore troublest me ? "
i thus : " instructor , now await me here ,
that i through him may rid me of my doubt .
thenceforth what haste thou wilt . " the teacher paus'd ,
and to that shade i spake , who bitterly
still curs'd me in his wrath . " what art thou , speak ,
that railest thus on others ? " he replied :
" now who art thou , that smiting others' cheeks
through antenora roamest , with such force
as were past suff'rance , wert thou living still ? "
" and i am living , to thy joy perchance , "
was my reply , " if fame be dear to thee ,
that with the rest i may thy name enrol . "
" the contrary of what i covet most , "
said he , " thou tender'st : hence ; nor vex me more .
ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale . "
then seizing on his hinder scalp , i cried :
" name thee , or not a hair shall tarry here . "
" rend all away , " he answer'd , " yet for that
i will not tell nor show thee who i am ,
though at my head thou pluck a thousand times . "
now i had grasp'd his tresses , and stript off
more than one tuft , he barking , with his eyes
drawn in and downward , when another cried ,
" what ails thee , bocca ? sound not loud enough
thy chatt'ring teeth , but thou must bark outright ?
what devil wrings thee ? " -- " now , " said i , " be dumb ,
accursed traitor ! to thy shame of thee
true tidings will i bear . " -- " off , " he replied ,
" tell what thou list ; but as thou escape from hence
to speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib ,
forget not : here he wails the frenchman's gold .
'him of duera , ' thou canst say , 'i mark'd ,
where the starv'd sinners pine . ' if thou be ask'd
what other shade was with them , at thy side
is beccaria , whose red gorge distain'd
the biting axe of florence . farther on ,
if i misdeem not , soldanieri bides ,
with ganellon , and tribaldello , him
who op'd faenza when the people slept . "
we now had left him , passing on our way ,
when i beheld two spirits by the ice
pent in one hollow , that the head of one
was cowl unto the other ; and as bread
is raven'd up through hunger , th' uppermost
did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain ,
where the spine joins it . not more furiously
on menalippus' temples tydeus gnaw'd ,
than on that skull and on its garbage he .
" o thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate
'gainst him thou prey'st on , let me hear , " said i
" the cause , on such condition , that if right
warrant thy grievance , knowing who ye are ,
and what the colour of his sinning was ,
i may repay thee in the world above ,
if that , wherewith i speak be moist so long . "
his jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
that sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head ,
which he behind had mangled , then began :
" thy will obeying , i call up afresh
sorrow past cure , which but to think of wrings
my heart , or ere i tell on't . but if words ,
that i may utter , shall prove seed to bear
fruit of eternal infamy to him ,
the traitor whom i gnaw at , thou at once
shalt see me speak and weep . who thou mayst be
i know not , nor how here below art come :
but florentine thou seemest of a truth ,
when i do hear thee . know i was on earth
count ugolino , and th' archbishop he
ruggieri . why i neighbour him so close ,
now list . that through effect of his ill thoughts
in him my trust reposing , i was ta'en
and after murder'd , need is not i tell .
what therefore thou canst not have heard , that is ,
how cruel was the murder , shalt thou hear ,
and know if he have wrong'd me . a small grate
within that mew , which for my sake the name
of famine bears , where others yet must pine ,
already through its opening sev'ral moons
had shown me , when i slept the evil sleep ,
that from the future tore the curtain off .
this one , methought , as master of the sport ,
rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
unto the mountain , which forbids the sight
of lucca to the pisan . with lean brachs
inquisitive and keen , before him rang'd
lanfranchi with sismondi and gualandi .
after short course the father and the sons
seem'd tir'd and lagging , and methought i saw
the sharp tusks gore their sides . when i awoke
before the dawn , amid their sleep i heard
my sons ( for they were with me ) weep and ask
for bread . right cruel art thou , if no pang
thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold ;
and if not now , why use thy tears to flow ?
now had they waken'd ; and the hour drew near
when they were wont to bring us food ; the mind
of each misgave him through his dream , and i
heard , at its outlet underneath lock'd up
the' horrible tower : whence uttering not a word
i look'd upon the visage of my sons .
i wept not : so all stone i felt within .
they wept : and one , my little anslem , cried :
" thou lookest so ! father what ails thee ? " yet
i shed no tear , nor answer'd all that day
nor the next night , until another sun
came out upon the world . when a faint beam
had to our doleful prison made its way ,
and in four countenances i descry'd
the image of my own , on either hand
through agony i bit , and they who thought
i did it through desire of feeding , rose
o' th' sudden , and cried , 'father , we should grieve
far less , if thou wouldst eat of us : thou gav'st
these weeds of miserable flesh we wear ,
'and do thou strip them off from us again . '
then , not to make them sadder , i kept down
my spirit in stillness . that day and the next
we all were silent . ah , obdurate earth !
why open'dst not upon us ? when we came
to the fourth day , then geddo at my feet
outstretch'd did fling him , crying , 'hast no help
for me , my father ! ' there he died , and e'en
plainly as thou seest me , saw i the three
fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth :
" whence i betook me now grown blind to grope
over them all , and for three days aloud
call'd on them who were dead . then fasting got
the mastery of grief . " thus having spoke ,
once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
he fasten'd , like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone
firm and unyielding . oh thou pisa ! shame
of all the people , who their dwelling make
in that fair region , where th' italian voice
is heard , since that thy neighbours are so slack
to punish , from their deep foundations rise
capraia and gorgona , and dam up
the mouth of arno , that each soul in thee
may perish in the waters ! what if fame
reported that thy castles were betray'd
by ugolino , yet no right hadst thou
to stretch his children on the rack . for them ,
brigata , ugaccione , and the pair
of gentle ones , of whom my song hath told ,
their tender years , thou modern thebes ! did make
uncapable of guilt . onward we pass'd ,
where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
not on their feet were turn'd , but each revers'd .
there very weeping suffers not to weep ;
for at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
impediment , and rolling inward turns
for increase of sharp anguish : the first tears
hang cluster'd , and like crystal vizors show ,
under the socket brimming all the cup .
now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
each feeling , as 't were callous , yet me seem'd
some breath of wind i felt . " whence cometh this , "
said i , " my master ? is not here below
all vapour quench'd ? " -- " 'thou shalt be speedily , "
he answer'd , " where thine eye shall tell thee whence
the cause descrying of this airy shower . "
then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd :
" o souls so cruel ! that the farthest post
hath been assign'd you , from this face remove
the harden'd veil , that i may vent the grief
impregnate at my heart , some little space
ere it congeal again ! " i thus replied :
" say who thou wast , if thou wouldst have mine aid ;
and if i extricate thee not , far down
as to the lowest ice may i descend ! "
" the friar alberigo , " answered he ,
" am i , who from the evil garden pluck'd
its fruitage , and am here repaid , the date
more luscious for my fig . " -- " hah ! " i exclaim'd ,
" art thou too dead ! " -- " how in the world aloft
it fareth with my body , " answer'd he ,
" i am right ignorant . such privilege
hath ptolomea , that ofttimes the soul
drops hither , ere by atropos divorc'd .
and that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
the glazed tear - drops that o'erlay mine eyes ,
know that the soul , that moment she betrays ,
as i did , yields her body to a fiend
who after moves and governs it at will ,
till all its time be rounded ; headlong she
falls to this cistern . and perchance above
doth yet appear the body of a ghost ,
who here behind me winters . him thou know'st ,
if thou but newly art arriv'd below .
the years are many that have pass'd away ,
since to this fastness branca doria came . "
" now , " answer'd i , " methinks thou mockest me ,
for branca doria never yet hath died ,
but doth all natural functions of a man ,
eats , drinks , and sleeps , and putteth raiment on . "
he thus : " not yet unto that upper foss
by th' evil talons guarded , where the pitch
tenacious boils , had michael zanche reach'd ,
when this one left a demon in his stead
in his own body , and of one his kin ,
who with him treachery wrought . but now put forth
thy hand , and ope mine eyes . " i op'd them not .
ill manners were best courtesy to him .
ah genoese ! men perverse in every way ,
with every foulness stain'd , why from the earth
are ye not cancel'd ? such an one of yours
i with romagna's darkest spirit found ,
as for his doings even now in soul
is in cocytus plung'd , and yet doth seem
in body still alive upon the earth .
" the banners of hell's monarch do come forth
towards us ; therefore look , " so spake my guide ,
" if thou discern him . " as , when breathes a cloud
heavy and dense , or when the shades of night
fall on our hemisphere , seems view'd from far
a windmill , which the blast stirs briskly round ,
such was the fabric then methought i saw ,
to shield me from the wind , forthwith i drew
behind my guide : no covert else was there .
now came i ( and with fear i bid my strain
record the marvel ) where the souls were all
whelm'd underneath , transparent , as through glass
pellucid the frail stem . some prone were laid ,
others stood upright , this upon the soles ,
that on his head , a third with face to feet
arch'd like a bow . when to the point we came ,
whereat my guide was pleas'd that i should see
the creature eminent in beauty once ,
he from before me stepp'd and made me pause .
" lo ! " he exclaim'd , " lo dis ! and lo the place ,
where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength . "
how frozen and how faint i then became ,
ask me not , reader ! for i write it not ,
since words would fail to tell thee of my state .
i was not dead nor living . think thyself
if quick conception work in thee at all ,
how i did feel . that emperor , who sways
the realm of sorrow , at mid breast from th' ice
stood forth ; and i in stature am more like
a giant , than the giants are in his arms .
mark now how great that whole must be , which suits
with such a part . if he were beautiful
as he is hideous now , and yet did dare
to scowl upon his maker , well from him
may all our mis'ry flow . oh what a sight !
how passing strange it seem'd , when i did spy
upon his head three faces : one in front
of hue vermilion , th' other two with this
midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest ;
the right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd : the left
to look on , such as come from whence old nile
stoops to the lowlands . under each shot forth
two mighty wings , enormous as became
a bird so vast . sails never such i saw
outstretch'd on the wide sea . no plumes had they ,
but were in texture like a bat , and these
he flapp'd i' th' air , that from him issued still
three winds , wherewith cocytus to its depth
was frozen . at six eyes he wept : the tears
adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam .
at every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
bruis'd as with pond'rous engine , so that three
were in this guise tormented . but far more
than from that gnawing , was the foremost pang'd
by the fierce rending , whence ofttimes the back
was stript of all its skin . " that upper spirit ,
who hath worse punishment , " so spake my guide ,
" is judas , he that hath his head within
and plies the feet without . of th' other two ,
whose heads are under , from the murky jaw
who hangs , is brutus : lo ! how he doth writhe
and speaks not ! th' other cassius , that appears
so large of limb . but night now re - ascends ,
and it is time for parting . all is seen . "
i clipp'd him round the neck , for so he bade ;
and noting time and place , he , when the wings
enough were op'd , caught fast the shaggy sides ,
and down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
between the thick fell and the jagged ice .
soon as he reach'd the point , whereat the thigh
upon the swelling of the haunches turns ,
my leader there with pain and struggling hard
turn'd round his head , where his feet stood before ,
and grappled at the fell , as one who mounts ,
that into hell methought we turn'd again .
" expect that by such stairs as these , " thus spake
the teacher , panting like a man forespent ,
" we must depart from evil so extreme . "
then at a rocky opening issued forth ,
and plac'd me on a brink to sit , next join'd
with wary step my side . i rais'd mine eyes ,
believing that i lucifer should see
where he was lately left , but saw him now
with legs held upward . let the grosser sort ,
who see not what the point was i had pass'd ,
bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then .
" arise , " my master cried , " upon thy feet .
the way is long , and much uncouth the road ;
and now within one hour and half of noon
the sun returns . " it was no palace - hall
lofty and luminous wherein we stood ,
but natural dungeon where ill footing was
and scant supply of light . " ere from th' abyss
i sep'rate , " thus when risen i began ,
" my guide ! vouchsafe few words to set me free
from error's thralldom . where is now the ice ?
how standeth he in posture thus revers'd ?
and how from eve to morn in space so brief
hath the sun made his transit ? " he in few
thus answering spake : " thou deemest thou art still
on th' other side the centre , where i grasp'd
th' abhorred worm , that boreth through the world .
thou wast on th' other side , so long as i
descended ; when i turn'd , thou didst o'erpass
that point , to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd
all heavy substance . thou art now arriv'd
under the hemisphere opposed to that ,
which the great continent doth overspread ,
and underneath whose canopy expir'd
the man , that was born sinless , and so liv'd .
thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere ,
whose other aspect is judecca . morn
here rises , when there evening sets : and he ,
whose shaggy pile was scal'd , yet standeth fix'd ,
as at the first . on this part he fell down
from heav'n ; and th' earth , here prominent before ,
through fear of him did veil her with the sea ,
and to our hemisphere retir'd . perchance
to shun him was the vacant space left here
by what of firm land on this side appears ,
that sprang aloof . " there is a place beneath ,
from belzebub as distant , as extends
the vaulted tomb , discover'd not by sight ,
but by the sound of brooklet , that descends
this way along the hollow of a rock ,
which , as it winds with no precipitous course ,
the wave hath eaten . by that hidden way
my guide and i did enter , to return
to the fair world : and heedless of repose
we climbed , he first , i following his steps ,
till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave :
thus issuing we again beheld the stars .
