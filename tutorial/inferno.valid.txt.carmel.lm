as were the torment , if each <unk> - <unk>

of <unk> , in the <unk> time

'twixt <unk> and <unk> , with the isle

<unk> and <unk> <unk> fen ,

had <unk> their <unk> all in one foss

together ; such was here the torment : dire

the <unk> , as issuing <unk> from <unk> limbs .

we on the utmost shore of the long rock

descended still to leftward . then my sight

was <unk> to explore the depth , wherein

the <unk> of the most mighty lord ,

all - <unk> justice , <unk> to punishment

the <unk> noted on her dread record .

more rueful was it not <unk> to see

the <unk> in <unk> <unk> , what time

each living thing , e'en to the little <unk> ,

all fell , so full of malice was the air

( and afterward , as <unk> of <unk> have told ,

the ancient people were restor'd <unk>

from seed of <unk> ) than was here to see

the spirits , that <unk> through the murky vale

up - <unk> on many a <unk> . <unk> they lay ,

one o'er the belly , o'er the shoulders one

roll'd of another ; <unk> <unk> a third

along the dismal <unk> . step by step

we journey'd on , in silence looking round

and <unk> those <unk> , who strove in vain

to <unk> their <unk> . then two i mark'd , that <unk>

<unk> 'gainst each other , as two <unk> <unk>

set to <unk> the heat . from head to foot ,

a <unk> <unk> them round . nor saw i e'er

<unk> <unk> so fast , for whom his lord

impatient waited , or himself perchance

<unk> with long <unk> , as of these each one

<unk> quickly his keen nails , through <unk>

of ne'er <unk> <unk> . the <unk>

came drawn from underneath in flakes , like <unk>

<unk> from the <unk> or <unk> of <unk> <unk> .

" o thou , who with thy <unk> <unk> off

thy <unk> of proof , " thus spake my guide to one ,

" and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of them ,

tell me if any born of latian land

be among these within : so may thy nails

serve thee for <unk> to this toil . "

" both are of <unk> , " weeping he replied ,

" whom tortur'd thus thou seest : but who art thou

that hast inquir'd of us ? " to whom my guide :

" one that descend with this man , who yet lives ,

from rock to rock , and show him <unk> abyss . "

then <unk> they asunder , and each turn'd

trembling toward us , with the rest , whose ear

those words <unk> struck . to me my liege

address'd him : " speak to them whate'er thou <unk> . "

and i <unk> began : " so may no time

<unk> your remembrance from the thoughts of men

in th' upper world , but after many <unk>

<unk> it , as ye tell me , who ye are ,

and of what race ye come . your punishment ,

<unk> and disgustful in its kind ,

<unk> you not from opening thus much to me . "

" <unk> was my dwelling , " answer'd one ,

" and me <unk> of <unk> brought

to die by fire ; but that , for which i <unk> ,

leads me not here . true is in sport i told him ,

that i had learn'd to wing my flight in air .

and he <unk> much , as he was <unk>

of wisdom , will'd me to declare to him

the secret of mine art : and only hence ,

because i made him not a <unk> ,

<unk> on one <unk> his sire to <unk> me .

but minos to this chasm last of the ten ,

for that i practis'd <unk> on earth ,

has doom'd me . him no <unk> <unk> . "

then to the bard i spake : " was ever race

light as <unk> ? sure not <unk> herself

can show a tribe so <unk> and vain . "

the other <unk> spirit heard my words ,

and thus return'd : " be <unk> from this charge

<unk> , he who knew so <unk>

to lay out <unk> <unk> ; and <unk>

who first the <unk> <unk> <unk>

discover'd in that <unk> , where such seed

<unk> <unk> in the soil : and be that troop

<unk> , with whom <unk> of <unk>

<unk> his <unk> and wide - <unk> <unk> ,

and his <unk> wisdom <unk> show'd

a <unk> for all . that thou mayst know

who <unk> thee against the <unk>

thus <unk> , bend this way thy sharpen'd sight ,

that well my face may answer to thy ken ;

so shalt thou see i am <unk> <unk> ,

who <unk> <unk> <unk> by the power

of <unk> ; and if i scan thee right ,

thus needs must well remember how i <unk>

<unk> nature by my <unk> art . "

what time <unk> burn'd in <unk> breast

for <unk> against the theban blood ,

as more than once in dire <unk> was rued ,

such fatal <unk> seiz'd on <unk> ,

that he his spouse <unk> with a <unk>

<unk> on either arm , " spread out , " he cried ,

" the <unk> , that i take the <unk>

and the young <unk> at the pass : " then forth

stretch'd he his <unk> talons , <unk> one ,

one helpless <unk> , <unk> nam'd ,

whom <unk> down he <unk> upon a rock ,

and with her other burden self - destroy'd

the <unk> mother <unk> : and when the pride

of all - <unk> troy fell from its height ,

by fortune <unk> , and the old king

with his realm <unk> , then did <unk> ,

a wretch <unk> and <unk> , when she saw

<unk> first <unk> , and her son ,

her <unk> , on the wild sea - <unk>

next met the <unk> view , then reft of sense

did she run <unk> even as a dog ;

such mighty power had grief to <unk> her soul .

<unk> ne'er the <unk> or of thebes or troy

with such fell cruelty were seen , their <unk>

<unk> in the limbs of man or beast ,

as now two pale and naked <unk> i saw

that <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the swine

<unk> from his <unk> . one reach'd <unk> ,

and in the neck - <unk> <unk> deep his fangs ,

dragg'd him , that o'er the solid <unk> <unk>

his belly stretch'd out prone . the other shape ,

he of <unk> , there left trembling , spake ;

" that <unk> of air is <unk> ; in like mood

of <unk> <unk> <unk> he still his <unk> . "

to whom i <unk> : " oh ! as thou dost hope ,

the other may not flesh its jaws on thee ,

be <unk> to inform us , who it is ,

ere it speed hence . " -- " that is the ancient soul

of wretched <unk> , " he replied , " who burn'd

with most <unk> flame for her own sire ,

" and a false shape <unk> , so <unk>

the deed of sin ; e'en as the other there ,

that onward passes , <unk> to <unk>

<unk> <unk> , to feign'd <unk>

the seal <unk> , that himself might <unk> ,

for his own <unk> , the lady of the herd . "

when vanish'd the two <unk> shades , on whom

mine eye was held , i turn'd it back to view

the other cursed spirits . one i saw

in fashion like a <unk> , had but the <unk>

been sever'd , where it <unk> the <unk> part .

<unk> <unk> , <unk> the limbs

with ill - <unk> <unk> , that the <unk>

suits not the visage , open'd wide his lips

<unk> as in the <unk> man for <unk> ,

one towards the chin , the other upward <unk> .

" o ye , who in this world of misery ,

wherefore i know not , are <unk> from pain , "

thus he began , " <unk> regard

<unk> woe . when living , full <unk>

ne'er <unk> me of what most i <unk> ;

one drop of water now , alas ! i <unk> .

the <unk> , that <unk> down the <unk> <unk>

of <unk> , <unk> fresh and <unk>

the banks whereby they <unk> to arno's stream ,

stand ever in my view ; and not in vain ;

for more the <unk> semblance <unk> me up ,

much more than the <unk> , which makes the flesh

desert these <unk> cheeks . so from the place ,

where i <unk> , stern justice <unk> me ,

takes means to <unk> more my <unk> sighs .

there is <unk> , where i <unk>

the <unk> with the <unk> form <unk> ,

for which on earth i left my body <unk> .

but if i here might see the <unk> soul

of guido , <unk> , or their <unk> ,

for <unk> <unk> spring i would not change

the <unk> sight . one is e'en now within ,

if <unk> the mad spirits tell , that round

are <unk> . but wherein <unk> me that ?

my limbs are <unk> . were i but so light ,

that i each hundred years might move one <unk> ,

i had set forth already on this path ,

<unk> him out amidst the <unk> crew ,

although <unk> <unk> it wind , not more

than <unk> of one across . they brought me down

among this tribe ; <unk> by them i <unk>

the <unk> with three <unk> of <unk> . "

" who are that <unk> <unk> , " i next inquir'd ,

" that <unk> <unk> thee upon thy right

lie <unk> , like a band in <unk> steep'd

in the <unk> stream ? " -- " when to this gulf i <unk> , "

he answer'd , " here i found them ; since that hour

they have not turn'd , nor ever shall , i <unk> ,

till time hath run his course . one is that dame

the false <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ;

<unk> the other , that false <unk> from troy .

sharp <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> out ,

in such a cloud <unk> . " when that he heard ,

one , <unk> perchance to be so <unk> nam'd ,

with <unk> hand smote him on the <unk> <unk> ,

that like a <unk> resounded : but forthwith

<unk> smote him on the face , the blow

returning with his arm , that seem'd as hard .

" though my <unk> limbs have <unk> from me

the power to move , " said he , " i have an arm

at <unk> for such <unk> . " to whom

was answer'd : " when thou <unk> to the fire ,

thou hadst it not so ready at command ,

then <unk> when it <unk> th' <unk> gold . "

and thus the <unk> : " ay , now <unk> thou true .

but there thou <unk> not such true <unk> ,

when thou wast question'd of the truth , at troy . "

" if i spake false , thou <unk> <unk> the <unk> , "

said <unk> ; " i am here but for one fault ,

and thou for more than any <unk> beside . "

" remember , " he replied , " o <unk> one ,

the horse remember , that did <unk> with death ,

and all the world be witness to thy guilt . "

" to thine , " return'd the <unk> , " witness the <unk>

whence thy tongue <unk> , witness the <unk> mound ,

rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes ,

a mass <unk> . " to whom the <unk> thus :

" thy mouth <unk> wide as ever to let pass

its evil <unk> . me if <unk> <unk> ,

yet i am <unk> with <unk> . thou art <unk> ,

pains <unk> thy head , no <unk> <unk> thou need

to make thee <unk> <unk> <unk> up . "

i was all fix'd to listen , when my guide

<unk> : " now <unk> : a little more .

and i do <unk> with thee . " i perceiv'd

how <unk> he spake , and towards him turn'd

with shame so <unk> , as remember'd yet

<unk> me . as a man that <unk> of harm

<unk> him , dreaming wishes it a <unk> ,

and that which is , <unk> as if it were not ,

such then was i , who <unk> power to speak

wish'd to <unk> myself , and all the while

<unk> me , though <unk> that i did .

" more grievous fault than thine has been , less shame , "

my master cried , " might <unk> . therefore cast

all sorrow from thy soul ; and if again

chance bring thee , where like <unk> is held ,

think i am ever at thy side . to hear

such <unk> is a joy for <unk> minds . "

the <unk> tongue , whose keen <unk> before

had <unk> me , that either cheek was stain'd ,

now <unk> my cure . so have i heard ,

achilles and his <unk> <unk> <unk>

pain first , and then the boon of <unk> restor'd .

turning our back upon the vale of woe ,

<unk> <unk> th' <unk> mound in silence . there

was <unk> dim , that far long the gloom

mine eye advanc'd not : but i heard a horn

<unk> aloud . the <unk> it <unk> had made

the thunder <unk> . following its course

the adverse way , my <unk> eyes were bent

on that one spot . so terrible a blast

<unk> <unk> not , when that dismal <unk>

<unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and quench'd

his <unk> warfare . <unk> not long

my head was rais'd , when many lofty towers

methought i spied . " master , " said i , " what land

is this ? " he answer'd straight : " too long a space

of <unk> darkness has thine eye

to <unk> : thou hast therefore <unk> <unk>

in thy <unk> . thither arriv'd

thou well shalt see , how <unk> can <unk>

the sense . a little therefore urge thee on . "

then <unk> he caught me by the hand ;

" yet know , " said he , " ere farther we advance ,

that it less strange may seem , these are not towers ,

but <unk> . in the <unk> they stand immers'd ,

each from his <unk> downward , round the bank . "

as when a <unk> <unk> <unk> ,

our <unk> <unk> what the mist <unk>

<unk> in air ; so piercing through the gross

and gloomy <unk> , as more and more

we <unk> toward the brink , mine error fled ,

and fear came o'er me . as with circling round

of <unk> , <unk> <unk> his walls ,

e'en thus the shore , <unk> th' abyss ,

was <unk> with <unk> , <unk> their length

<unk> , horrible , whom <unk> from heav'n

yet <unk> , when his <unk> thunder <unk> .

of one already i descried the face ,

shoulders , and breast , and of the belly huge

great part , and both arms down along his <unk> .

all - <unk> nature , when her <unk> hand

left <unk> of these <unk> , did <unk>

past doubt her wisdom , <unk> from mad war

such <unk> to do his <unk> ; and if she

<unk> her not of th' <unk> and <unk> ,

who <unk> well <unk> her <unk>

<unk> and more <unk> ; for when brute force

and evil will are <unk> with <unk> ,

<unk> none avails . his visage seem'd

in length and <unk> , as doth the <unk> , that <unk>

saint peter's <unk> <unk> ; and th' other bones

of like <unk> , so that from above

the bank , which <unk> him below , such height

<unk> his <unk> , that three <unk>

had <unk> in vain to <unk> but to his hair .

full <unk> ample palms was he expos'd

downward from whence a man his <unk> <unk> .

" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , "

so shouted his fierce lips , which <unk> <unk>

became not ; and my guide address'd him thus :

" o <unk> spirit ! let thy horn for thee

<unk> : <unk> <unk> thy rage , if rage

or other <unk> <unk> thee . search thy neck ,

there shalt thou find the <unk> that <unk> it on .

wild spirit ! lo , upon thy mighty breast

where hangs the <unk> ! " then to me he spake :

" he doth <unk> himself . <unk> is this ,

through whose ill counsel in the world no more

one tongue <unk> . but pass we on , nor waste

our words ; for so each language is to him ,

as his to others , understood by none . "

then to the leftward turning sped we forth ,

and at a <unk> <unk> found another shade

far <unk> and more huge . i <unk> say

what master hand had <unk> him ; but he held

behind the right arm <unk> , and before

the other with a <unk> , that <unk> him

from the neck down , and five times round his form

<unk> met the <unk> <unk> . " this proud one

would of his strength against almighty <unk>

make trial , " said my guide ; " whence he is thus

<unk> : <unk> him they call .

" great was his <unk> , when the <unk> brought

fear on the <unk> : those arms , which then he <unk> ,

now moves he never . " forthwith i return'd :

" fain would i , if 't were <unk> , mine eyes

of <unk> <unk> gain'd

<unk> next . " he answer'd : " thou shalt see

not far from hence <unk> , who both speaks

and is <unk> , who shall place us there

where guilt is at its depth . far onward stands

whom thou wouldst fain behold , in <unk> , and made

like to this spirit , save that in his looks

more fell he seems . " by violent <unk> <unk>

ne'er shook a <unk> , so <unk> to its base ,

as <unk> . more than ever then

i <unk> death , nor than the terror more

had <unk> , if i had not seen the <unk>

that held him fast . we , straightway journeying on ,

came to <unk> , who five <unk> <unk>

without the head , forth issued from the cave .

" o thou , who in the <unk> vale , that made

great <unk> <unk> of glory , when his sword

drove back the troop of <unk> in flight ,

who thence of old didst carry for thy <unk>

an hundred <unk> ; and if thou hadst fought

in the high <unk> on thy <unk> side ,

seems as men yet believ'd , that through thine arm

the sons of earth had conquer'd , now vouchsafe

to place us down beneath , where <unk> <unk>

locks up <unk> . force not that we <unk>

or <unk> help or <unk> . here is one

can give what in this realm ye <unk> . <unk>

therefore , nor <unk> <unk> thy lip .

he in the upper world can yet <unk>

renown on thee , for he doth live , and looks

for life yet longer , if before the time

<unk> call him not unto herself . " thus spake

the teacher . he in haste forth stretch'd his hands ,

and caught my guide . <unk> <unk> felt

that grapple <unk> <unk> . soon as my guide

had felt it , he bespake me thus : " this way

that i may <unk> thee ; " then so caught me up ,

that we were both one burden . as <unk>

the <unk> of <unk> , from beneath

where it doth <unk> , if chance a passing cloud

so <unk> across , that opposite it hangs ,

such then <unk> seem'd , as at mine <unk>

i mark'd him <unk> . i were fain at times

t' have pass'd another way . yet in th' abyss ,

that <unk> with <unk> low <unk> ,

<unk> he plac'd us ; nor there leaning <unk> ,

but rose as in a bark the <unk> <unk> .

could i command rough <unk> and hoarse , to <unk>

that <unk> of sorrow , o'er which <unk> rock

his firm <unk> <unk> , then might the vein

of <unk> rise full <unk> : but not mine

such <unk> , and with <unk> <unk> i touch

the mighty theme ; for to <unk> the depth

of all the universe , is no <unk>

to <unk> with , and <unk> a tongue not us'd

to infant <unk> . but let them <unk>

my song , the tuneful <unk> , by whose aid

<unk> <unk> in thebes , so with the truth

my speech shall best <unk> . oh ill - <unk> <unk> ,

beyond all others wretched ! who abide

in such a <unk> , as scarce thought <unk> words

to speak of , better had ye here on earth

been <unk> or mountain <unk> . as down we stood

in the dark <unk> beneath the <unk> feet ,

but lower far than they , and i did gaze

still on the lofty <unk> , a voice

<unk> me thus : " look how thou <unk> . take

good heed , thy <unk> do tread not on the heads

of thy <unk> <unk> . " <unk> i turn'd ,

and saw before and underneath my feet

a lake , whose <unk> surface <unk> seem'd
