OPTIMIZATIONS

1. Check if updateGradient and bProp in Linear_diagonal_layer can be sped up using broadcasting. Right now it's a loop.

NECESSARY
1. testNeuralNetwork.h needs to be modified significantly to match with the current code. For example, line 64 has 100 hard coded. 
2. Need to check gradients, need to add code that prints out the perplexity of the output layer.
